# Overview

- `00_exploration.ipynb` — quick EDA on raw prices (plots, return distribution).
- `90_pipeline_demo.ipynb` — runs the entire pipeline from scripts and previews outputs.
- `91_backtest_report.ipynb` — equity curves per strategy/model and KPI table.

> Notebooks are **consumers** of the pipeline. The source of truth is in `src/`.
